# Project-1
First GitHUb project with IBM.

on 16th December 2023, I got the system to continue my career path in data science.
A friend recommennded me to IBM and it has been intriguing ever since then, the explanations of each subject matter has been mind blowing,
the quizes to help their student understand the course more is very effective. i'm happy to learn more about datascience with IBM.
Kudos to the team that worked hard to put this together.
cheers!!!
